### More on Country limitation

Unfortunately, if you have already created an account you will have to create a new one and enrol devices again.

Canada, The United States, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Myanmar(Burma), Guatemala, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay, Hongkong SAR China, Macao SAR China, Taiwan China, Puerto Rico, Curacao
